////////////////

Today:
- more with direct proofs
- contrapositive proofs
- proofs by contradiction
- proofs with sets

Example.

The square of any odd integer is odd.



If an integer is odd then its square is odd

(for all integers x, if x is odd, then x^2 is odd)

Direct proof:

Let x be an odd integer. If x is odd, then x = 2k + 1 where k
is some integer. Squaring both sides of x = 2k +1, we have:
    x^2 = (2k+1)^2
        = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
        = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1


Thus x^2 = 2b + 1 where b is the integer 2k^2 + 2k, and so
x^2 is odd.

Proof by contrapositive

--> Also for proving things of the form "If P, then Q"


What is the contrapositive of P → Q?
    ¬Q → ¬P







Proof by contrapositive template:

Assume ¬Q
...
Goal: ¬P


//////////////////////////////////////////

Example (contrapositive)

If x^2 is odd for an integer x, then x is odd.

Think of as P → Q
    P: x^2 is odd (where x is an integer)
    Q: x is odd

Contrapositive?
    If x is an integer that is not odd, then x^2 is not odd


Try direct proof first.
    trying to prove: If x^2 is odd for an integer x, then x is odd.

Direct proof. Assume x^2 is odd for some integer x. If x^2 is odd,
then x^2 = 2k + 1 for some integer k.

    we get stuck: would need to take sqrt of x^2, and
    that gives us something messy

...(want: x is odd, so need x = 2m + 1 where m is an integer)





Proof (contrapositive).
(If x is an integer that is not odd, then x^2 is not odd)

Let x be an integer that is not odd. Since x is not odd, it must
be even, and so x = 2k where k is an integer. Squaring both
sides of x = 2k, we have:
    x^2 = 4k^2
        = 2(2k^2)

Thus x^2 = 2b where b is the integer 2k^2, and so x^2 is even.
Since x^2 is not odd, it must be even.




--> best to indicate in proof that you are using contrapositive

////////////////////////////////

Mistakes in proofs.

We want to "prove" that 1 = 2.


"Proof:"
Let a and b be two equal positive integers. We have that:

    1) a = b                    (premise)

    2) a^2 = ab                 (reason -
                                multiplied both sides by a)

    3) a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2     (reason -
                                subtract b^2 from both sides)

    4) (a-b)(a+b) = b(a-b)      (reason - factored both sides)

    5) a+b = b                  (reason - divide both sides by
                                    a-b)

    6) 2b = b                   (reason? how do a and b compare?
                                we had assumed a = b)

    7) 2 = 1                    (reason? - divided by b)


What went wrong? we got to step 5 by dividing by a-b,
but a = b and so we were dividing by 0

//////////////////////////////////////

Proof by contradiction.

- same idea as PbC in natural deduction

- assume that what you are trying to prove is not true

- try to get a contradiction

- conclude what you are trying to prove is true after all




/////////////////////////

Proof by contradiction template 1 (trying to prove P)


Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, ¬P.
...
C ^ ¬C.

We have a contradiction between C and ¬C, so P must hold.





//////////////////////////

Proof by contradiction template 2 (trying to prove If P, then Q):


Assume P.
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, ¬Q.
...
C ^ ¬C.
We have a contradiction between C and ¬C, so Q must hold.





///////////////////////////

Example (use proof by contradiction):

If x^2 is even for an integer x, then x is even.

(which template?) 2

Assume x^2 is even for some integer x. Suppose, for the sake of
contradiction, that x is not even. If x is not even, it must
be odd, and so x = 2k + 1 where k is an integer. Squaring
both sides of x = 2k + 1, we have:
    x^2 = (2k + 1)^2
        = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
        = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1

Thus x^2 = 2b + 1 where b is the integer 2k^2 + 2k, and so
x^2 is odd by definition. If x^2 is odd, then it is not even,
which contradicts with our previous assumption that x^2 is even.

Thus x must be even.

...(want: a contradiction)



//////////////////////////

Definitions: "rational" / "irrational"

A number r is *rational* if r = p/q for some integers p and q,
where q ≠ 0.



Any number that is not rational is irrational,
and any number that is not irrational is rational.

//////////////////////////

Example: use proof by contradiction to prove that sqrt(2)
is irrational.

(which template? 1)

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that sqrt(2) is rational.
If sqrt(2) is rational, then sqrt(2) = p/q where p and q are
integers and q != 0. We pick p and q to share no common factors,
so that p/q is fully reduced.

Squaring both sides of sqrt(2) = p/q, we get:
    2 = p^2/q^2

Multiplying both sides by q^2, we have:
    2q^2 = p^2

Thus p^2 = 2b where b is the integer q^2, and so p^2 is even
by definition. Thus p is also even by our previous proof.
If p is even, then p = 2k where k is some integer.

Plugging in p = 2k to 2q^2 = p^2, we have:
    2q^2 = (2k)^2
         = 4k^2

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
    q^2 = 2k^2

Thus q^2 = 2a where a is the integer k^2, and so q^2 is even.
We know q must also be even by our previous proof.

This gives us that both p and q are even, which means they
must share 2 as a common factor. This contradicts with our previous
assumption that p and q didn't share any common factors.

Thus sqrt(2) is irrational.

/////////////////////////////////

Proofs with sets.

Prove that A ⊆ B?
    --> how would we express this in predicate logic?

∀ x ∈ A → x ∈ B

    --> proof template?

Pick a random individual. Assume the random individual is an
element in A, prove that the random individual is an element in B.


Prove that A = B? Prove A ⊆ B and then that B ⊆ A


///////////////////////////////

Example.

Prove that {x : x = 4k + 2, k ∈ ℤ} ⊆ {x : x = 2a, a ∈ ℤ}

A = {x : x = 4k + 2, k ∈ ℤ}
B = {x : x = 2a, a ∈ ℤ}

A: what elements? all numbers that are 2 bigger than some multiple
    of 4


B: what elements? all even numbers


Proof that A ⊆ B.

Let x ∈ A. If x is in A, then x = 4k + 2 where k is an integer.
We have that:
    x = 4k + 2
      = 2(2k+1)

Thus x = 2a where is integer 2k+1, and so x ∈ B.

Thus A ⊆ B.




///////////////////////////////

Definition: "divides"

Suppose a and b are integers. We say that a *divides* b,
written a | b, if b = ak for some k ∈ Z.

In this case we also say that:
    a is a *divisor* of b
    a is a *factor* of b
    b is a *multiple* of a.


3 divides 12, 3 | 12

3 is a divisor of 12, 12 is a multiple of 3

(how do we know, by using definition?)
    12 = 3*4 where 4 is an integer


2 | 7 - no! 2 is not a factor of 7.

///////////////////////////////

⋂: means?



Prove that {x : x ∈ ℤ, 2|x} ⋂ {x : x ∈ ℤ, 3|x} = {x : x = 6a, a ∈ ℤ}

Let A = {x : x ∈ ℤ, 2|x} (A is all even numbers)
Let B = {x : x ∈ ℤ, 3|x} (B is all multiples of 3)
Let C = {x : x = 6a, a ∈ ℤ} (C is all multiples of 6)


Prove A ⋂ B ⊆ C.
Let x ∈ A ⋂ B. Thus x ∈ A and x ∈ B.

(...then use what we know about x being in A
and x being in B, and then show that x matches
the format of C).


...then we would need to prove C ⊆ A ⋂ B.
