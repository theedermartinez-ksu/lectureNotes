Exam 2:
- Thursday, October 10 9:30-10:45
- Closed notes, closed computers
- All "open-ended" problems - similar to HW 4-6

- Natural deduction proofs in propositional logic, esp. with:
    ImplyI, NegE, NegI, BottomE, PbC
--> still expected to be familiar with all other rules
--> may be more emphasis here than previous semesters,
    as more of these rules are on Exam 2 than in the past

Sets, including:
    - set builder notation
    - N (natural, all positive, starts at 1), Z (integers),
            R (reals - includes whole numbers, fractions,
            numbers with decimals)
    - union, intersection, difference (-), subsets
    - general reasoning about sets

Predicate logic statements, including:
    - quantifiers
    - interpreting predicate logic statements in English
    - translating English statements to predicate logic
    - evaluating predicate logic statements in a domain
    - working with predicate logic statements involving sets
        of numbers
    - DeMorgan's laws
    - negating predicate logic statements

- Natural deduction proofs in predicate logic
    using: AllE, AllI, ExistsI

- Using natural deduction to prove two statements are equivalent
    I would complete two proofs:

    statement1 |- statement2

    and also:

    statement2 |- statement1


--> what about predicate logic proof syntax?
    don't care about getting all the ()
    don't care about putting : T or [T]
    in AllI subproof, be sure to name your random individual
    can write ∀((x: T) => (P(x) -> Q(x))) like
        ∀ x (P(x) -> Q(x))


--> how to prepare?
    get out paper
    work through old homework problems
    work through old lecture examples

--> homework solutions

Work through practice exam (will post solution after class)
