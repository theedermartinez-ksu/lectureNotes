Suppose we have the following predicates:

P(x, y): person x is partners with person y
CS(x): person x is a CS major
ECE(x): person x is an ECE major
KS(x): person x is from Kansas


For each statement:
a) Translate it to English
b) Negate it, showing your work (any OR statement should be converted to an ->)
c) Translate your negation to English


1. ∀ x (KS(x) V ¬CS(x))

Translation: All people are from KS or aren't CS majors
    (equivalently, all CS majors are from KS)

Negation:

    !(∀ x (KS(x) V ¬CS(x)))
    E x !(KS(x) V ¬CS(x))
    E x (!KS(x) ^ CS(x))

Translation of negation:
There is a person who isn't from KS and is a CS major


2. ∃ x (ECE(x) ^ ∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y)))

Translation: There is an ECE major who is partners with everyone from KS


p → q is equivalent to ¬p V q

Negation:

¬(∃ x (ECE(x) ^ ∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y))))
∀ x !(ECE(x) ^ ∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y))))
∀ x (!ECE(x) V ¬(∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y))))
∀ x (!ECE(x) V (∃ y ¬(KS(y) → P(x, y))))
∀ x (!ECE(x) V (∃ y ¬(¬KS(y) V P(x, y))))
∀ x (!ECE(x) V (∃ y (KS(y) ^ ¬P(x, y))))
∀ x (!ECE(x) V (∃ y (KS(y) ^ ¬P(x, y))))
∀ x (ECE(x) → (∃ y (KS(y) ^ ¬P(x, y))))

Translation of negation: All ECE majors have a person from KS that
they are not partners with.
