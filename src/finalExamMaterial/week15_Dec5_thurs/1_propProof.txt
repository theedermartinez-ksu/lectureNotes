Complete the following propositional logic proof:

( (p ∧ q) → r, r → s, q ∧ ¬s ) ⊢ ( ¬p )
Proof(
  1 ( (p ∧ q) → r ) by Premise,
  2 ( r → s ) by Premise,
  3 ( q ∧ ¬s ) by Premise,

  //COMPLETE THE PROOF
  4 ( q ) by AndE1(3),
  5 ( ¬s ) by AndE2(3),

  6 SubProof(
    7 Assume ( p ),
    8 ( p ∧ q ) by AndI(7, 4),
    9 ( r ) by ImplyE(1, 8),
    10 ( s ) by ImplyE(2, 9),
    11 ( F ) by NegE(10, 5)
    //goal: contradiction
  ),
  12 ( ¬p ) by NegI(6)
  //use NegI to conclude ¬p
)
