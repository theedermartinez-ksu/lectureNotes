Use a truth table to prove that the following argument is valid.

Premises: p → q, q → ¬r
Conclusion: p → ¬r


Explain from your results why we know the argument is valid.

proving argument valid: show that every truth assignment that makes
each premise true also makes the conclusion true

proving argument invalid: find one truth assignment that makes
all premises true but the conclusion false

We can see that every truth assignment that makes all the premises
true also makes the conclusion true
